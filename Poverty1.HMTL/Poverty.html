Question + Hypothesis + Goal </h2></div>
<div class="boxed"></div></center>
<br>
<font size="4"> <strong> Question: </strong> How do differences between men and women's income affect the amount of people in poverty?
<br>
<br>
<strong> Hypothesis: </strong>  If women are paid less than men, then they are more likely to live in poverty.
<br>
<br>
<strong> Goal: </strong> Discover the gap between men and women’s income. Furthermore, we wanted to find the difference between how many men live in poverty and how many women live in poverty.

<li>Woman’s paycheck averaging 81.5 cents to every man’s dollar.</li>
<br>
<li>If working women were given equal wages to men, their poverty rate would fall from 8.2% to 4.0%.</li>
<br>
<li>
This would also decrease the rate of children with working mothers living in poverty from 5.6 million to 3.1 million.</li>
<br>
<li>The United States economy would have produced income of $512.6 billion more if women received equal pay; this represents 2.8 percent of 2016 gross domestic product (GDP).

Data Analysis</h2></div>
<p><font size="5">
While men have a higher average income than women, more women are in poverty. Therefore, these graphs conclude that a lower wage is one of the factors that leads to poverty. Because women have lower wages than men, they have a higher likelihood of experiencing poverty"</font></p>
<div style="width:650px; height: 30px; background-color:#cccccc;"><h2 style="color:#000066">
Conclusion</h2></div>
<div class="boxed"></div>
<p><font size="5">
In conclusion, our data shows a correlation between the amount of women in poverty and the wage gap: men are paid more than women but, more women are in poverty, making income a significant factor in poverty. However, there are many factors that go into poverty. Each man, woman, and family has a different background, situation, place of residence, race, sexuality, and countless other factors. We can only conclude that there is no set “equation” for falling into poverty, but we can confidently say that the gender wage gap plays a role in the journeys of many families living in poverty. Therefore, there is not enough evidence to conclude that the wage gap causes more women to be in poverty than men. While we cannot come to a clear conclusion, we know that there are many more factors to explore in this topic, and we are interested to see how our nation attempts to solve this problem and help those in poverty in the future.

Purpose</h2></div>
<div class="boxed"></div></center>
<br>
<font size="5">When each member of our group wrote their paragraphs about what they wanted to focus on for the capstone project, we all wrote about wanting to help people. While brainstorming, we thought studying poverty would be interesting and very applicable to our world today. We explored many different factors that go into poverty, and eventually came across a data set that showed how the gender pay gap impacted the amount of women and families in poverty. We found this interesting and wanted to learn more, so we got graphing!</font>
